At Measurely, we are committed to building a secure platform. While we take security seriously, **vulnerabilities** may still arise.

If you discover a security issue, please report it so we can address it promptly. Your assistance helps us improve Measurely for everyone.

Since Measurely is an evolving project, we currently do not have a formal Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP). However, we encourage responsible disclosure by reaching out to us at info@measurely.dev

### Out of Scope Vulnerabilities:

- Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.
- Unauthenticated/logout/login CSRF.
- Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a userâ€™s device.
- Attacks requiring social engineering.
- Any activity that could disrupt our service (DoS).
- Content spoofing and text injection without a clear attack vector.
- Email spoofing.
- Missing DNSSEC, CAA, CSP headers.
- Lack of Secure or HTTP-only flag on non-sensitive cookies.
- Deadlinks.
- User enumeration.

### Testing Guidelines:

- Do not run automated scanners on our platform. Unauthorized scanning can disrupt services and violate our Terms of Service.
- Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue. Do not modify or delete any data that does not belong to you.

### Reporting Guidelines:

- Email info@measurely.dev with details of the issue.
- Provide clear steps to reproduce the vulnerability so we can address it efficiently.

### Disclosure Guidelines:

- Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until we have confirmed, addressed, and communicated with affected users.
- If you plan to share research on a Measurely vulnerability, notify us at least 30 days before publication.

### What We Promise:

- We will acknowledge your report within 5 business days.
- If you follow responsible disclosure practices, we will not take legal action against you.
- We will handle your report confidentially and will not share your personal details without your consent.
- We will keep you updated on our progress in resolving the issue.
- We will credit you as the discoverer of the vulnerability in public reports (unless you request otherwise).

As Measurely grows, we plan to introduce a more structured security program. Thank you for helping us make Measurely safer!
