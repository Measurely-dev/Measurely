# Basic metric

The **Basic Metric** allows users to track and display a single value metric over time. Whether you're tracking the number of users, sales, or any other key metric, this feature provides a clear and concise way to visualize that data. It's perfect for scenarios where you need to monitor a singular value that reflects progress or performance.

<Callout type="warning">
  The value of a Basic Metric is always positive. This is because Basic Metrics
  track a singular value, and any changes to this value represent increments,
  counts, or other positive measurements. If you need to track both positive and
  negative values, consider using a **Dual Metric** instead
</Callout>

## How to Create a Basic Metric

<Steps>

### Access the Metrics Page

Navigate to the Metrics section in the Measurely dashboard.

### Click Create Metric

Here, you'll have the option to select between a Basic Metric or a Dual Metric. Choose Basic Metric.

### Enter Metric Details

Provide a name for your metric (e.g., "Sales Count").

### API KEY Integration

To send data to this metric, integrate your Measurely API KEY into your project.

</Steps>

## Viewing Your Basic Metric

Once your basic metric is created, you can view it directly in the dashboard. Measurely provides an intuitive graphical representation, showing the trend of the tracked value over time.

**Graphical Representation:** The chart will show a line or bar indicating how your metric has changed, allowing you to spot trends.

## Example Use Cases

- **Tracking Website Visits:** A basic metric could track daily website visits.
- **Sales Reporting:** Monitor the total sales of a product or service within a set time frame.
- **User Registration:** Track the number of new user sign-ups each day or week.
