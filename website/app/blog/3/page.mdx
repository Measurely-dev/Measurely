# Measurely goes open source

![Measurely goes open source](../_covers/blog-3.png)

We believe transparency and collaboration drive progress. That’s why we’ve made **Measurely open source**.

By going open source, we're giving developers complete access to our platform. You can use it, customize it, and even contribute to make it better. This approach ensures that Measurely evolves with your needs, supported by the very people who rely on it.

### Why Open Source?

- **Transparency**: See exactly how Measurely works under the hood. No secrets, no guesswork—just clean, open code.
- **Trust**: Know the tools you’re using and have full control over your data.
- **Collaboration**: Join a growing community of developers working together to improve Measurely and expand its capabilities.
- **Flexibility**: Use the platform as-is or tailor it to your unique requirements.
