# Privacy Policy

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us by email at [info@measurely.dev](mailto:info@measurely.dev).

At Measurely, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our platform.

## Information We Collect

Measurely collects information provided directly by you when you sign up for an account, use the platform, or interact with our support team. The types of information we collect include:

- Personal identification information (name, email address, etc.)
- Authentication data through external providers (such as Google and GitHub) for login purposes
- Subscription and payment details (such as billing address and payment method, which are processed by third-party payment providers)

## Cookies for Authentication

Measurely uses cookies strictly for authentication purposes. When you log in using external providers such as Google or GitHub, we use cookies to maintain your session and ensure secure access to the platform. These cookies are necessary for the functioning of the platform and are not used for tracking or advertising purposes.

## External Authentication Providers

We use external providers, such as Google and GitHub, for user authentication. When you sign up or log in to Measurely using one of these services, the provider will share certain personal information (such as your name and email address) with us to verify your identity and create your user account. This information is stored securely and used only for authentication and account management purposes.

## Payment Information

Payment for Measurely subscriptions is processed on a monthly basis through Stripe. All payment information, including billing details and payment methods, is handled by Stripe, and Measurely does not store or process your payment information directly. Stripe uses encryption and other security measures to protect your payment information.

For more details, please refer to Stripe's privacy policy here: [Stripe Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

## Data Usage

All data collected within Measurely is used exclusively within the platform to provide the core functionality of the service, including but not limited to:

- Managing user accounts and subscriptions
- Providing custom metrics and related services
- Delivering customer support

Measurely does not share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. We will never share your data outside of the platform unless required by law or for essential services like payment processing, where third-party providers are involved in the transaction.

## Changes to Subscriptions

As Measurely evolves, subscription plans may change. This could include updates to feature limits, pricing adjustments, or the introduction of new subscription types. Any changes to the subscription plans will be communicated to users in advance, and you will have the option to adjust your plan accordingly.

## Data Security

We take data security seriously and use industry-standard encryption and security practices to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. We encourage users to take their own precautions to protect their personal data.

## Online Privacy Policy Only

This privacy policy applies solely to activities on our website and within the Measurely platform. It does not cover information collected offline or through other channels.

## Consent

By using Measurely, you consent to the terms outlined in this privacy policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please refrain from using our platform.

## Policy Updates

Should we update, amend, or make any changes to this policy, those changes will be posted here, and the "last updated" date will be revised accordingly. It is your responsibility to review this policy regularly for any changes.

If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms of Service, please contact us at [info@measurely.dev](mailto:info@measurely.dev).
