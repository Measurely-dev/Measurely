# Average Metric

The **Average Metric** allows users to track and display the average value of a metric over time. This feature is ideal for scenarios where you need to analyze trends in data that fluctuates, such as average daily revenue, user ratings, or any other value that requires averaging. It calculates the mean of data points over a period, giving you an accurate view of performance.

<Callout type="info">
  The value of an Average Metric can fluctuate, reflecting the averaging of
  multiple data points. This makes it useful for tracking metrics where values
  vary frequently, such as average temperature, or average sales per day.
