---

#
Measurely-js is a lightweight JavaScript library for interacting with the Measurely API, enabling developers to manage and track custom metrics programmatically using JavaScript.

## Installation

To use the Measurely package in your JavaScript/Node.js project, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install measurely-js
```

## Usage

### 1. Initialize the Measurely package

Before you can send any metrics to Measurely, you need to initialize the package with your API key. The `init` function accepts your API key as a string and sets it for use in subsequent API calls.

```javascript
const measurely = require('measurely-js');

// Initialize the Measurely package with your API key
measurely.init("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

### 2. Send a Metric (Capture)

The `capture` function is used to send metric data to Measurely. You need to pass the metric identifier (which is a unique name or ID for the metric) and the metric value you want to track.

#### Example of sending a metric

```javascript
const measurely = require('measurely-js');

// Initialize the Measurely package with your API key
measurely.init("YOUR_API_KEY");

// Create a metric payload
const payload = {
  value: 42
};

// Capture the metric and get the result
measurely.capture("example_metric", payload)
  .then(result => {
    if (result.success) {
      console.log("Metric captured successfully!");
    } else {
      console.log("Error capturing metric:", result.message);
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
```

### 3. Error Handling

The `capture` function returns a promise that resolves to a `CaptureResult` object containing two fields:

- `success` (boolean): Indicates if the API call was successful.
- `message` (string): Contains the response message from the server, which could either be a success message or an error message.

## API Reference

#### `init(API_KEY : string) : void `

- **Description**: Initializes the Measurely package with your API key.
- **Parameters**:
  - `API_KEY`: The API key provided by Measurely.
- **Returns**: None.

#### `capture(metric_identifier : string, payload : CapturePayload) : Promise<CapturePayload>`

- **Description**: Sends a metric value to Measurely for tracking.
- **Parameters**:
  - `metric_identifier`: The unique identifier for the metric you are capturing.
  - `payload`: An object containing the metric value to be recorded.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to a `CaptureResult` object.

### Types

#### `CaptureResult`

```javascript
{
  success: boolean,  // Indicates if the API call was successful
  message: string    // Contains the server's response or an error message
}
```

- **Description**: This object represents the result of the API call to capture a metric.
- **Fields**:
  - `success` (boolean): Indicates if the metric capture was successful.
  - `message` (string): Contains the server's response or an error message.
