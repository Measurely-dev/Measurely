<Note title='Warning' type='warning'>
  The value of a Basic Metric is always positive. This is because Basic Metrics
  track a singular value, and any changes to this value represent increments,
  counts, or other positive measurements. If you need to track both positive and
  negative values, consider using a **Dual Metric** instead
</Note>

## Getting Started

In Measurely, the **Basic Metric** allows users to track and display a single value metric over time. Whether you're tracking the number of users, sales, or any other key metric, this feature provides a clear and concise way to visualize that data. It's perfect for scenarios where you need to monitor a singular value that reflects progress or performance.
