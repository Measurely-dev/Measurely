## What is a Filter?

A **filter** is a key-value pair used to enrich your metrics with additional metadata. Filters allow you to categorize, segment, and analyze your data more efficiently by providing context to your tracked events.

## Why Use Filters?

Filters help you:

- **Segment your data** – Group metrics by meaningful attributes (e.g., environment, region, user type).
- **Improve analytics** – Gain deeper insights by filtering and comparing specific metric subsets.
- **Enhance visualization** – Use filters to create more focused charts and reports in Measurely.
- **Support flexible queries** – Retrieve only the relevant data when analyzing trends.

## Example Use Cases

- **Environment-based tracking:** Monitor metrics separately for `production`, `staging`, or `development` environments.
- **Geographical segmentation:** Analyze user activity across different regions such as `us-east` or `eu-west`.
- **User-based insights:** Categorize metrics by user roles (e.g., `admin`, `guest`, `member`).

## How to Create a Filter

Filters are added as key-value pairs in your metric payload. Here's how to define and use them when capturing a metric.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define your filters:** Identify key attributes to add, such as `environment`, `region`, or `user_id`.
2. **Attach filters to your payload:** Include a `filters` object in the request when sending metrics.
3. **Use filters in analysis:** Apply filters in Measurely’s dashboard to refine your data views.

## Example in TypeScript

Below is an example of adding filters when capturing a metric using the Measurely TypeScript SDK:

```typescript
import { Measurely } from 'measurely-sdk';

// Initialize Measurely with your API key
const measurely = new Measurely('your_api_key');

// Define filters
const filters = {
  environment: 'production',
  region: 'us-east',
  user_type: 'admin',
};

// Create a metric payload with a value and filters
const payload = {
  value: 42,
  filters: filters,
};

// Capture the metric
measurely
  .capture('example_metric', payload)
  .then((result) => {
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Metric captured successfully!');
    } else {
      console.error('Error capturing metric:', result.message);
    }
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
  });
```

## Best Practices for Filters

- **Use standardized keys:** Maintain consistency with naming conventions like `environment`, `region`, or `user_type`.
- **Keep filters relevant:** Avoid unnecessary filters that don’t contribute to meaningful segmentation.
- **Optimize for performance:** Minimize the number of filters per metric to ensure efficient querying and storage.
- **Utilize filters for dashboard insights:** Leverage filters in Measurely’s UI to create dynamic charts and comparisons.

Filters are a powerful tool to organize, analyze, and extract deeper insights from your data. Use them strategically to maximize the value of your metrics.
