## What's Coming to Measurely?

We're super excited about some upcoming features that will take Measurely to the next level! These additions are designed to make your experience smoother and even more powerful, whether you’re working alone or with a team. Let’s dive into what's coming soon:

---

### Multi-Metric Tracking (Highest Priority)

This one’s huge! With multi-metric tracking, you’ll be able to create a metric that contains other metrics, allowing them to all impact a single chart. This is perfect for tracking more complex interactions, like user engagement across different activities.

**Exact definition**:  
_"Multi-metric combines multiple variables to give a complete overview, ideal for tracking complex interactions like user engagement across various activities."_

This will enable a deeper level of insight and provide a more holistic view of your data. If you're looking to track multiple related metrics in one go, this is the feature you’ve been waiting for.

### Measurely Teams

Soon, you'll be able to manage or be part of a team for each application on Measurely. This feature will allow you to collaborate with your team members, assign roles, and streamline your workflow all within the platform. Whether you're working on a startup project or a larger enterprise app, this new functionality will help you stay organized and efficient.

### Customizable chart Pages

We’re also introducing customizable block pages, where you can create charts **(blocks)** and organize them however you like. You'll be able to track any metric within your app and present your data exactly how you want it. This flexibility is all about giving you control over how your information is visualized, making it easier to spot trends and act on insights.
