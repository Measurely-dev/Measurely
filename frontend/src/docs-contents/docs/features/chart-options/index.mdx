## Getting Started

Measurely's **Advanced Options** enhance how you view and analyze your metrics. These options allow you to customize your experience for better insights and usability.

## Starting Point

The **Starting Point** feature allows you to offset the range of data by choosing a specific date from a calendar. For example, if you select "Last 7 Days" and adjust the starting point, it will shift the 7-day range to begin from your chosen date.

  <StepperItem title='Step 4: Adjust the Chart'>
    The chart will automatically adjust to show data starting from the specified date.

## Chart Ranges

Define the time range for your chart to analyze specific periods. Available ranges include:

- **Today**
- **Last 7 Days**
- **Last 15 Days**
- **Last 30 Days**
- **Last Year** (not available for Starter plan users)

## Offset Arrows

The **Offset Arrows** allow you to shift the chart range backward or forward in time, one range interval at a time. For example, if you have selected "Last 7 Days," clicking the left arrow will move the range back to the 7 days before that (e.g., 14â€“7 days ago).
