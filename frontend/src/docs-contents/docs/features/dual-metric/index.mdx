description: How to track and view two-value metrics with Measurely's Dual Metric feature, allowing the tracking of positive and negative values.

## 

<Note title="Quick definition" type="note"> 
A **Dual Metric** allows you to track both positive and negative values. When creating a dual metric, youâ€™ll have two separate values: one for positive data and one for negative data. This allows you to track data like gains vs. losses, income vs. expenses, or any other scenario where both values are relevant.
</Note>

## Getting Started

In Measurely, the **Dual Metric** enables users to track and display two separate values: one for positive measurements and one for negative measurements. Whether you're tracking revenue and expenses, gains and losses, or other dual data points, this feature helps you visualize the relationship between the two values over time.

## Viewing Your Dual Metric

Once your dual metric is created, you can view it directly in the dashboard. Measurely offers a graphical representation that compares both the positive and negative values over time.
## 
**Graphical Representation:** The chart will show two lines or bars, one representing positive values and the other representing negative values, enabling you to visually compare the two metrics.

## Example Use Cases
**Revenue vs. Expenses:** Track the revenue and expenses over time to measure profitability.
## 
**Gains vs. Losses:** Monitor stock or investment gains and losses on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
## 
**User Growth vs. Churn:** Compare the number of new users to users lost over a given period.
